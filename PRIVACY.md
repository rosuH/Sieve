## Sieve Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** 2024-07-15

rosuH built the Sieve app as a Free app. This SERVICE is provided by RosuH at no cost and is intended for use as is.

This page is used to inform visitors regarding our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use our Service.

If you choose to use our Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The Personal Information that we collect is used for providing and improving the Service. We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.

**Information Collection and Use**

Sieve does **not** collect any personal information from your device. This includes, but is not limited to:

* Personally identifiable information such as your name, email address, or location data.
* Usage data, such as how often you use the app or which features you access.

**App Permissions**

Sieve requires access to the following permissions:

* **Query All Packages:** This permission is required to read the list of installed applications on your device. This information is used solely for the purpose of displaying a list of apps within Sieve and is not stored or transmitted outside of your device. Sieve only accesses the package name, app name, and icon for each installed app.

**Why We Need This Permission:** The Query All Packages permission is essential for Sieve to function as it allows the app to compile and display a comprehensive list of all installed applications. Without this permission, Sieve cannot provide its core functionality of app filtering and management.

**Subscription Handling**

Sieve allows users to download and import subscriptions containing app filtering rules. These subscriptions are text-based files and may be hosted online.

* **Downloading Subscriptions:** When you choose to download a subscription, Sieve accesses the internet to retrieve the subscription file.
* **Reading Subscriptions:** Sieve reads the downloaded subscription files to understand the filtering rules you have chosen to apply. These rules typically involve package names but do not contain any personal information.

**Subscription File Security:** We ensure that subscription files are sourced from reliable and secure locations to protect the integrity and safety of your data.

**Data Usage**

* **Filtering Applications:** Sieve applies the downloaded subscription rules to filter the list of installed applications on your device. This process happens locally on your device.
* **Exporting Results:** Sieve allows you to export the list of filtered applications. This list contains only the package names of apps and is not linked to any personal data.

**Changes to This Privacy Policy**

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and through in-app notifications. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.
